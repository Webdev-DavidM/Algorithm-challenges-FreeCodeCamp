# Algorithm-challenges-FreeCodeCamp

This project is a JS file which contains all the basic and intermediate algorithm challenges from freecodecamp which I completed. I completed about 90% without requiring assistance.  These really helped me to solidify my knoweldge of the following
areas

1) Using regular expressions
2) Using the argument objects
3) Using the reduce method
4) Thinking about a problem and using pseudo code before starting

Some of them took 20 minutes, some of them afew hours but the exercise was extremely useful in reincreasing my knowledge and confidence with Javascript
